# Conversation Selection and Viewport Model

This document defines the ownership and completion rules for conversation switching and message
viewport positioning. It is a contract for future changes, not a description of one incident.

## Evidence from the db808d7 artifact

The portable artifact used for the `16fd66a` state-model analysis was built from clean commit
`db808d7`. Its performance log shows that
selection and data projection were usually fast, while stage 6 (scroll positioning) frequently took
roughly 240-334 ms. Some navigation traces stayed open until the 8 second timeout. The same sessions
also contain repeated long frames and layout shifts.

The old UI could therefore reach this state:

1. `activeChatId` changed and the sidebar highlighted the destination.
2. A full-conversation snapshot still covered the destination until positioning reported completion.
3. A second click issued a new latest-position request and happened to release the snapshot sooner.

At the bottom of a conversation, Virtuoso, viewport/content resize observers, message mount callbacks,
and a multi-frame pin loop could all write `scrollTop`. Observer notifications restarted the loop, so
the list could alternate between Virtuoso's correction and the application's correction.

## State ownership

There are only two authoritative inputs:

- The Telegram store owns the selected destination: `activeChatId` and `activeTopicId`.
- `App` owns one `ConversationScrollRequest`, a discriminated command with `entry`, `latest`, or
  `message` semantics and a monotonically increasing `requestId`.

There must not be separate entry/latest/message request states. A request is meaningful only when its
`chatId` matches the selected chat. `Conversation` derives its entire header, message projection, and
viewport command from that same selected destination.

## Selection transaction

Every user-visible route into a conversation follows this order:

1. Resolve the destination chat/topic and the viewport intent.
2. In one synchronous React transaction, issue the viewport command and call `selectChat` or
   `selectForumTopic`.
3. Let the destination shell render immediately. A bounded visual handoff may cover measurement
   latency, but it must not participate in destination selection or positioning.
4. Start or continue background history work using the captured destination generation.
5. Ignore an asynchronous result when its generation or request is no longer current.

Selection methods are synchronous by contract. Read markers, history loading, and cache writes may
continue in the background, but callers must never await them before committing the selected
destination.

An interactive, state-owning, or unbounded conversation switch snapshot is prohibited. The current
visual handoff is deliberately narrower: it clones only the already rendered shell into a closed
shadow root, copies canvas pixels, is `aria-hidden`, inert, and ignores pointer input. Destination
readiness starts its 90 ms release and a 1500 ms bound removes it even when readiness never arrives;
resize, unmount, and a newer switch cancel it. It cannot choose a destination, write scroll state,
or delay background work. A separate local snapshot remains valid for an explicit in-conversation
message jump because that operation has one owner and one list. For a distant virtual relocation the
snapshot stays still, and only the final controlled deceleration is revealed; source and destination
must not run separate whole-list transforms.

## Reentering a conversation

The native transport synchronizes TDLib `openChat`/`closeChat` with selection so
channel and supergroup updates remain subscribed. These requests serialize in
the background and never delay the synchronous selection transaction. Session
reset invalidates pending transitions before another account can take ownership.
Channel posts in the actual viewport are reported through `viewMessages` once
per visit, including each reentry and connection recovery. Overscan only warms
media and does not report views. Interaction updates continue through the
existing message update path; failures retry while the post remains visible.
Pin service events remain in stored history but are excluded from conversation
and discussion projections, independently of pinned-post metadata and banners.

Ordinary entry preserves the reading viewport from departure, including a viewport that was at
the bottom. Current-view following is not an instruction to follow messages that arrive while
the conversation is closed. Save the visible message anchor and offset even while following,
along with whether the viewport actually reached the raw bottom and the last known message.
An unchanged tail at a saved bottom resumes bottom alignment on entry. If the tail grew, a
viewport that was actually at the bottom and following may also resume following when the last
old message and every new message fit completely in the current viewport. Use measured height,
including album metadata, date/group spacing and the end sentinel, rather than message counts.
An entry with no local old-tail boundary or reading anchor keeps its saved reading position.
A partial history context cannot establish that every arrival is present, so it also preserves
the reading position even when its projected tail happens to fit.
Explicit latest navigation and incoming messages in an already following, open conversation
retain their behavior.

Measure a candidate tail while entry is hidden, using the existing anchor positioning owner.
Only fully mounted content with known media geometry can establish fit; an unknown image ratio
or incomplete rich content preserves the checkpoint. Verify again after bottom settlement to
include arrivals during positioning. Publish the first visible viewport only after the chosen
bottom or reading anchor is stable. A later media load must not reconsider an already shown
entry. Leaving during measurement restores the immutable departure checkpoint; stale callbacks
cannot publish a result in another conversation.

For short lists, preserve the leading flex space in the measured Header while restoring the
old viewport. Otherwise restoring the anchor would require a negative scroll offset. Explicit
latest navigation or an entry whose tail fits releases that space and resumes normal bottom alignment.

The departure capture reads the live scroller and Virtuoso handle when called; their refs may not
be available when the capture effect first registers. Validate the list identity and positioning
completion before writing memory. Switching away while restoring must preserve the prior
checkpoint, and a late snapshot callback cannot overwrite a newer capture. Account/topic/view
scopes remain independent.

Before capturing a settled, following viewport, reconcile any outstanding raw bottom displacement
through the existing coordinator. A child resize or passive virtualizer correction may precede its
observer; that transient gap must not become a detached departure checkpoint. Reading, navigation,
and active input retain the coordinator's existing priority and cancellation rules.

Freeze the entry checkpoint before layout effects update live message counts. An anchor absent
from the projected history first uses the existing context loader and history-window selector.
Loading is bounded and tied to the current positioning generation; navigation or user input
invalidates it. If recovery fails, prefer another saved visible message at its original offset,
then a chronological neighbor (successor before predecessor), rather than defaulting to latest.
Do not publish readiness or expose the unpositioned destination while a local anchor is pending.
The existing anchor/bottom coordinators remain the only owners of final alignment.

## Positioning completion

`positioning=false` means the requested geometry is stable, not merely that a correction was queued.
The performance stage `positioned` and `aria-busy=false` are published only by the final settlement
callback. Controlled message navigation must not reuse the user-scroll interrupt path, because a user
interrupt intentionally accepts the current geometry while a controlled navigation does not.

Destination changes invalidate all positioning work by identity and generation. A stale callback may
not publish completion, write memory, or change the current scroll mode.

## Bottom following coordinator

Bottom following has one writer: the coordinator in `useConversationScroll`.

- Resize, total-height, and message-mount callbacks only request reconciliation.
- Requests with the same identity and generation are coalesced; notifications do not restart the
  quiet window.
- The coordinator samples geometry until two quiet animation frames or an eight-frame bound.
- Tracking requests keep the bottom aligned while viewport or content geometry changes. A final
  conditional write starts a bounded verification pass because that write can trigger another
  Virtuoso measurement correction.
- User upward intent, pointer control, a detached scroll mode, or a destination generation change
  cancels the request.
- A passive scroll displacement can arrive after a tracking request has settled. While following,
  a raw bottom distance greater than the existing 1px rounding tolerance requests another bounded
  settlement. Preserve this tolerance: repeatedly correcting the last pixel can create a feedback loop.
  It does not restart a pending settlement or override active user input/navigation. Passive events
  describe movement, not its author; `isTrusted` alone never establishes user intent.
- The viewport observer, composer resize callback, message-mount callback, and Virtuoso's
  `totalListHeightChanged` signal may report committed geometry, but only the coordinator may write
  `scrollTop`. Observer notifications coalesce into the active request.
- A real row resize and a virtual-list layout commit must reconcile active tracking before paint,
  including repeated notifications within the same frame. They do not extend its deadline. Observe
  actual rows for late child-content changes after a transaction has settled. Do not discard per-row
  subpixel changes: their sum may be visible. A clamped scroll assignment that makes no progress is
  not a successful write and must not start another verification pass.
- A virtual-list layout commit after settlement must also check a following viewport for raw
  bottom displacement and request tracking before paint. Waiting for a later resize/scroll signal
  exposes an already positioned conversation with its newest message clipped by the composer.
- Do not observe the virtualized content node to request bottom pins. Its size can change in response
  to a pin, creating a resize-pin-measurement feedback loop even when no application content changed.

Virtual rows contain their sender/day margins, and top spacing belongs to a measured Header at every
responsive breakpoint. Preserve fractional item dimensions instead of rounding each row: independent
rounding accumulates into a different endpoint than the DOM. The 12px Footer is scrollable content;
only the final 1px rounding tolerance at the raw scroll maximum may absorb downward wheel input.
Latest navigation approaches that endpoint under one application-owned animation or reconciliation
pass. If the final row is already mounted, the application skips Virtuoso's `LAST/end` command because
that command measures against the row while the application endpoint includes the Footer. An index
command is used only when it must mount an unrendered tail; the bounded bottom coordinator then owns
the final raw maximum correction.

Layout measurement must not temporarily shrink live content. Removing a wrapped
metadata class and restoring it in the same task still lets a forced layout clamp
the ancestor's scroll position. Restoring the class restores the height, not the
offset. Folded quotes therefore choose their dedicated metadata row before any
inline measurement; an already wrapped text/caption flow probes the alternative
layout in a hidden, inert, fixed-position copy with the same CSS width. Text
bubbles include their row's sizing context so a wider viewport can restore inline
metadata; fixed-width captions only copy the flow. The copy is removed synchronously
and cannot own scrolling or enter the virtual row model.
This rule applies to text, photo captions, album captions, and discussion messages,
including readers detached just above the bottom. Never compensate for a probing
mutation by adding another scroll writer.

Text metadata measurements share a phased queue: collect live geometry, insert all
necessary probes, read all line rectangles, remove all probes, then publish results.
The virtual list flushes that queue once after its children commit; resize notifications
are deduplicated by flow. Do not reintroduce per-message synchronous measurement or
parent state updates to mirror a child's wrapped class. Bubble padding follows that
class through CSS. Text layout results belong to immutable content through a WeakMap,
with at most eight geometry/metadata variants. Validate the actual width, typography,
text/metadata DOM and quote state before reusing a result. Quote line measurements and
Markdown parser output also survive remounts in bounded caches (256 sources/512,000
source characters, up to eight quote variants); source caches clear on account changes.
Parser trees are copied before downstream plugins may mutate them. Cached values must
never retain live DOM, event callbacks, selection state or media side effects.
Resize delivery drains after the shared observer batch in the same frame. Explicit
quote expansion/collapse drains the affected row before the viewport owner computes
its anchor. A child layout commit informs that owner without mirroring child state
in the bubble or rerendering the conversation.

Cold positioning waits for mounted rich-text/math fallbacks and loading fonts to
resolve before final settlement, for at most one second. A fallback's initial height
does not establish visual readiness. Superseding selection and user input continue
to cancel positioning through its existing generation owner.

Middle-button autoscroll outlives pointerup and the short wheel/key input timeout. Both row observers
and total-height callbacks must yield detached anchoring for its entire lifetime, until explicit input
or window blur ends it.

### Virtual index origin and viewport anchors

`firstItemIndex` is a size-cache origin, not a viewport anchor. The resolver computes prefix
displacements from ordered stable virtual block IDs (including sponsored blocks), against the last
committed render: subtract inserted blocks only when the entire old sequence is an unchanged suffix
of the new one, and add removed blocks only for the inverse operation.

Each reading prepend has one geometry owner. During continuous detached scrolling, use the resolved origin
and let Virtuoso preserve motion. Its temporary content margin and deferred `scrollBy` form one
pass; application layout, row-resize and total-height callbacks must yield until that margin clears.
Do not cancel that ownership guard on wheel input or cover this pass with a static snapshot. Capture
the final live reading position when it ends. An idle reader instead keeps the committed origin and
uses the before-mutation application anchor, including grouping and late-content adjustments. A
single input followed by a pause is idle: compare input sequence against the pagination request's
checkpoint, which survives cancellation of its old anchor. Programmatic navigation and bottom following
retain their existing positioning paths. Never run reading-anchor compensation alongside
Virtuoso's prepend compensation. Cache origins and block sequences commit together; abandoned
renders do not publish either.

Idle history transactions capture the visible body, media card or album caption by message identity,
plus up to two surviving neighbors. Keep those content positions, not a sender header's row top:
pagination can turn the old first message into a group continuation and remove its header. If the
content changes size/topology (for example a single photo becoming an album tile), prefer a captured
unchanged neighbor and never switch back within that transaction. Missing content falls back to the
existing row anchor. All application layout/resize callbacks use the same transaction's content
points. Release the static snapshot after those positions and dimensions converge, with the existing
bounded deadline; `ui_history_render.timedOut` distinguishes deadline release. Re-capture ordinary
row-based reading memory from the final live viewport, so later passive resizes do not interpret a
body offset as a row offset. Explicit input, navigation and view changes cancel this ownership.

Upward intent requests the next history page within one viewport of the loaded boundary, with a
64px minimum. Passive scroll/measurement events never arm requests. Finishing a request while the
reader is still near the boundary does not itself start another visible-page load.

Interior insertions/deletions, tail edits, group splits/merges, mixed changes and independent history
window replacements keep the origin. Mounted rows remeasure at their current indexes. Stable block
identity survives a member deletion or a pending-message ID confirmation, so neither counts as a
removed block. Bottom and non-prefix detached changes remain owned by the existing before-mutation
viewport capture and coordinator. Neither the tail message nor the preferred reading anchor may
shift the global size cache.

`ui_conversation_viewport` provides numeric-only native evidence once per second while the current
viewport is visible, and emits only when endpoint geometry or control state changes. It records the
raw scroll maximum separately from the visible Footer/message gap, clipping by ancestors, row
measurement error, scale and following/input state. Negative gaps mean content extends below the
visible viewport; `latestRowPresent` distinguishes the mounted tail from the actual latest message.
Sampling owns no scroll writes or resize reconciliation. These records diagnose persistent endpoint
failures; ordinary frame-drop events alone cannot establish pixel movement.

### Conversation diagnostics

The diagnostic build also records `ui_conversation_trace`, `ui_conversation_row`, and
`ui_conversation_member` through the existing numeric-only performance log and export pipeline.
This is instrumentation, not a scroll behavior fix. It starts for the current conversation only while
the persisted performance-monitoring switch is on (enabled by default for existing installations).
The switch is shared across windows and also controls `ui_conversation_viewport`. Turning it off
disposes diagnostic timers, animation frames, input/scroll listeners, and trace identity tables;
hot-path hooks skip diagnostic layout reads and record construction. Pending records are discarded,
while an already submitted native log batch may finish. Turning it on creates a fresh trace session
without remounting the conversation or replaying activity from the disabled interval.
No server message/chat/user IDs, text, URLs, button data, paths, or keyboard text are written.

`traceSession` identifies one mounted conversation observer; `traceRun` identifies one burst within it.
`messageToken`, `replyToken`, and `partitionToken` are opaque session-local counters, not hashes of IDs.
`rowToken` identifies the actual DOM node; `revisionToken` identifies an in-memory message object.
Thus the same logical message can be distinguished from a replaced DOM node or new object revision.
Tokens are not comparable across sessions/windows. The ID table is bounded to 4096 entries; zero means
unknown/over budget. Object identities use weak references. A conversation/account switch disposes
the observer and its ID table. Use the existing `windowId` with these keys across native windows.

Every trace record includes `traceSeq` and `traceTimeMs`. Reconstruct event time as
`traceOriginMs + traceTimeMs`; `observedAtMs`/native `timestampMs` are emission times and may be later
because pre-trigger evidence is buffered. A start marker precedes replayed history, so file order is
not necessarily event order. History can appear in successive runs; deduplicate by session/sequence
when combining runs.

Collection policy:

- Idle geometry stays at 1 Hz and is deduplicated. The most recent 96 callback/input/write events
  stay in memory. The 100 ms housekeeping timer performs no geometry reads while idle.
- A remote deletion or ghost creation triggers a burst (`triggerKind=1`). Geometry sampling can also
  trigger it for row error >8 px (`2`), or following the latest message with >32 px bottom distance,
  <-8 px latest gap, or >8 px ancestor clipping without active pointer/autoscroll (`3`). These are
  capture thresholds, not declarations that ordinary navigation is broken.
- A burst lasts at most 8 seconds or 640 records, including its terminal record. Starts are separated
  by at least 30 seconds; repeated callbacks cannot extend the deadline. `finishKind` is `1` for time,
  `2` for output budget, `3` for disposal. `droppedCount` reports overwritten/unemitted callback entries.
- During a burst, each animation frame reads raw scroll metrics. Every 100 ms the trace reports
  extrema, sample count, and direction reversals, preserving evidence of movement between snapshots.
  Row snapshots run at most every 250 ms: the mounted tail plus the largest measurement errors,
  at most eight rows. `selectedRowCount`/`mountedRowCount` make this sampling explicit.
- Rows record cached/actual height, layout height, relative top, width, offsetTop, transform/scale,
  logical/absolute indexes, partition/node identity, and removing-member counts. Member records map
  individual anonymous messages to expected/actual indexes whenever a selected row's membership
  changes (up to 16 members per row; `memberCount` exposes truncation). New runs resend membership.
- Live-message and deletion lifecycle evidence is also flushed outside bursts, including cooldown,
  so a bot's later self-deletion is not lost just because the geometry burst ended. This queue keeps
  at most 32 pending lifecycle records and flushes at most once per second while idle.
- Hiding the document pauses frame/row reads. Visibility/focus events and terminal elapsed time
  identify gaps; absence of a sample is not evidence of stable geometry. Disposal cancels all
  observer timers/listeners/frames. Existing file rotation and performance-log drop reporting apply.

`traceKind` decoding:

| Code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 1 / 2 | Burst start / end |
| 3 | Per-frame scroll extrema and reversal summary |
| 4 | Application scrollTop assignment: requested, previous, and actual clamped value |
| 5 | Passive scroll event; `trusted` does not imply human input |
| 6 | Requested Virtuoso index scroll, alignment, offset, and smooth flag |
| 7 / 8 | Before-mutation / committed-list notification, including index/count changes |
| 9 / 10 | Real row resize / virtualizer total-height notification |
| 11 / 12 | Removal settling transaction started / released |
| 13 / 14 | Input category / document visibility or window focus change |
| 15 / 16 | Committed message upsert / received deletion event |
| 17 / 18 | Removal ghost created / expired, including timer deadline lag |
| 19 / 20 | Immediate removal / local deletion archive retained |
| 21 | Scroll-control snapshot: generation, follow mode, ownership, anchor, input window |
| 22 | Size returned to Virtuoso's itemSize callback, before it updates its size cache |
| 23 | Idle lifecycle queue truncation/drop count |

`writerKind`: `1` bottom pin, `2` latest animation, `3` latest approach,
`4` anchor correction, `5` resized-row correction, `6` jump animation, `7` target reveal,
`8` selection autoscroll, `9` selection return. Index commands are separately recorded as kind 6.
Browser anchoring, focus scrolling, and Virtuoso's internal corrections do not pass through the
application's scrollTop helper. They remain observable as kind 5 / frame changes without a matching
kind 4. Do not label an unattributed movement as a definite browser or library write.

`inputKind`: wheel, keydown, pointerdown, pointerup, pointercancel = 1..5.
`keyKind`: ArrowUp, ArrowDown, PageUp, PageDown, Home, End, Space = 1..7; all other keys = 0.
`contentKind`: text, rich, media, file, sticker, service, unsupported = 1..7; other kinds = 0.
`mediaKind`: photo, video, animation, audio, voice = 1..5; other kinds = 0.
`scrollMode`: following, detached, restoring, navigating = 0..3.
`reconcileMode`: settle, track, motion = 0..2; no transaction = -1.

For deletion investigations, follow a `messageToken` from remote deletion through ghost expiry and
the commit/index records. Compare the same `rowToken` and `partitionToken` before/after mapping
changes, then compare kind 22 measurements to the next cached heights. Finally align application
writes, passive scroll changes, control ownership, and frame extrema. This distinguishes a wrong
cache mapping, genuine content resizing, repeated scroll correction, and a DOM-node replacement.

Anchor and explicit message navigation use longer quiet windows because virtual rows can mount several
frames after the target first appears.

## Required invariants

- A selected chat row, conversation header, and rendered message IDs always name the same destination.
- One click commits the destination; a second click is never part of the switching protocol.
- Any source-view visual handoff is non-interactive, cannot own state, and is removed within its
  bounded lifecycle.
- `positioned` is emitted once per current request and only after its settlement callback.
- A following conversation remains visually motionless across idle frames.
- A detached conversation never moves because of a bottom-following notification.
- Async history results cannot restore an older selection or viewport command.

## Stable timeline partitions and visual readiness

Semantic sender/day grouping and virtual partition identity have different lifetimes.
The timeline projector reconciles against the last **committed** partitions for the same
account, conversation and view. New history is packed independently of existing partitions;
live messages can fill the final partition. Deleting a partition's first message does not
rename its surviving siblings. A sender/day change or an album topology change may split
the affected partition, but must not repack unrelated partitions. Albums remain atomic and
the four-message target continues to bound ordinary partitions and sender-avatar geometry.

Commit the projection reference in a layout effect. Do not mutate a global partition cache
during render: an interrupted render must not redefine the next committed view. Nested React
keys must use the same stable partition identity, and album identity must not depend on its
first loaded member.

Virtuoso measurements are reusable only when the ordered message-to-partition mapping,
message object versions, viewport width, language and geometry-affecting preferences still
match. Equal first/last message IDs and row counts are insufficient. A stable conversation
surface supplies width before the destination scroller mounts. Capture message versions
as weak references so size snapshots do not retain evicted history; keep at most 32 size
snapshots. Eviction does not remove semantic reading memory. On a mismatch, retain the
reading anchor and let the destination measure its actual layout.

`npm run test:performance:switch` builds an isolated production React/Mock benchmark
under ignored artifacts and performs 30 warm switches at 250ms intervals while editing.
Require zero long tasks, frame interval P95 below 22ms and maximum below 40ms,
synchronous click P95 below 16.7ms, editor processing P95 below 8ms, and first-frame
editor response P95 below 40ms. Unchanged warm text performs no line-rectangle reads.
Development runs enforce cache and behavior correctness; JSX development checks
make their timings unsuitable as production acceptance. These Chromium gates
do not prove native WebView2 or 240Hz acceptance; compare native builds against the
same account/history and retain separate blocking, positioning and visual release metrics.

Positioning feedback belongs to the viewport transaction. It may appear after a delay, but
must unmount in the same commit that publishes a positioned view. It has no independent
minimum lifetime or exit animation over destination messages. The source snapshot continues
to use its bounded, presentation-only release protocol.

Image resource readiness survives virtual row remounts through bounded URL metadata. A
previously decoded image that is already loaded in the new element is revealed before paint
without replaying an entrance. A cache hit alone must never expose an unloaded or failed
element; stale source decodes must not publish readiness for a replacement.

Regression checks must include partial same-sender history pages at the production partition
size, deletion of a partition head, restored image opacity and node identity, source-decode
races, and loading/positioned handoff at both short and long response times. An unchanged
reading offset alone does not establish visual continuity.

The focused unit and browser tests cover command consistency, source-row isolation, unread-marker
settlement, repeated warm switching, bounded geometry reads, idle bottom stability, long-message edit
entry/cancel/save, and detached edit anchoring.

## History windows and recovery ownership

`ConversationHistory` owns separate refresh and reader cursors for each chat/topic. Transport calls
with an explicit `HistoryPageRequest` return the next cursor without consuming another window's
cursor. The existing history pager, message merge rules, deletion facts and sync generations remain
shared. A stale response cannot publish into a discarded scope or a new account/recovery generation.

The message cache is broader than the displayed timeline. A disjoint context loaded by search/reply
navigation has its own membership and older cursor. It remains cached while the latest timeline
excludes those context-only records. Normal pagination can admit returned records into the latest
timeline. Overlapping real server pages can join windows; numerical gaps between IDs cannot establish
or disprove continuity. Explicit navigation selects a window in the same transaction as its existing
viewport request. End/latest selects the latest window; jump return can select a cached context and
restore its original pixel offset. A context's local bottom is not the latest conversation window.

Recovery captures the recent server-message boundary before accepting new live updates. It refreshes
from the head until that boundary is returned/passed or the server confirms exhaustion. Distant
context membership is never a recovery target. Each recovery has a total nine-page budget (including
the first page), rather than an eight-page limit that silently restarts every five seconds. A budget
stop preserves the cursor and publishes `recovery: paused`; it neither deletes unconfirmed messages
nor claims completion. Explicit older loading continues that repair from its committed cursor with a
one-page budget per gesture, including retries after a request failure. Taking manual ownership cancels
a queued background retry, so it cannot resume a nine-page scan after the reader stops. Reconnect
starts a new background budget while preserving the unfinished boundary. An accepted partial or
stalled manual page stays paused until the next gesture. Request failures before page acceptance and
background stalls have a bounded three-attempt retry path using the existing retry queue. Switching
accounts clears all window and retry ownership. Reconnect retires requests but preserves reader
windows and their cursors.

A cold cache has no continuity guarantee: it may contain an old tail plus a newer head page saved
after an interrupted recovery. Its first refresh must walk through the oldest ordinary cached
message outside explicit contexts, rather than stopping at the newest cached ID. After validation,
ordinary reconnects use the recent boundary again. An unfinished refresh keeps its original boundary
across further reconnects; accepting a newer page does not prove that the remaining gap is filled.

When the head page has not reached that boundary, older unconfirmed cache records move into an
existing-style context window. They remain available to saved reading anchors and are persisted via
`historyContexts`, but cannot appear immediately adjacent to the head page in the latest timeline.
Subsequent server pages admit them through the normal window merge. Upward loading resumes paused
or failed refreshes from the committed refresh cursor and coalesces with an active refresh. Pending
recovery keeps the latest window pageable even if its pre-disconnect reader had reached the oldest
message. Completion restores that reader's exhaustion state; it does not delete unconfirmed records.

Retained deletion archives have independent persistence and do not establish coverage of ordinary
server history. A restored chat can contain only 60 recent ordinary messages alongside much older
archives. Each window keeps its oldest covered message boundary; latest admits archives at or above
that boundary, and contexts also apply their newest boundary. Confirmed server exhaustion admits the
remaining older archives. Boundaries survive deletion of their original message, and retained copies
remain cached while outside the visible window. Explicit navigation can select a retained copy in a
separate context without treating the intervening history as loaded. A retained copy alone cannot
join distant server windows.

Reader pagination walks duplicate cached pages until it extends the displayed history, reaches a
confirmed end, stalls, or consumes the same nine-page budget. Each accepted page commits its cursor;
an error can retry from that cursor, while account/recovery generations still reject stale pages.
This keeps a single upward gesture useful after restart without starting an unbounded cache scan.
Numeric reader cursors never move toward newer messages, including when an endpoint repeats a page.

Optional `historyContexts` in cache schema 4 preserves only membership present in the bounded saved
message cache. It contains no claim that an entire old cache is contiguous. Legacy caches remain
usable without this metadata; malformed optional metadata is ignored. Cache membership never takes
precedence over permanent deletion or a newer live edit.

The virtual index adapter derives from the last committed mapping. Following views preserve a
surviving bottom row; detached views preserve their reading anchor. Index/layout caches are written
only on commit. Structural changes establish a bounded bottom-follow transaction before mutation,
so list layout notifications reconcile that same owner before paint. Equivalent message refreshes
preserve existing message objects and arrays.

History diagnostics use `ui_history_data`: `purpose` 1 is recovery and 2 is reader pagination.
`stopReason` 1 means complete/page accepted, 2 stalled/no cursor progress, 3 inactive scope,
4 total budget reached and 5 request failure. `remainingBoundaryCount` is zero only when recovery
completed. These numeric fields are accepted by the native logging boundary; no message identifiers
or bodies are included.

The native pager caps each window at the requested number of distinct older messages. A response
may include the cursor message or omit it; the reserved boundary slot must never admit an extra older
message. Overflow remains for the next request, whose cursor is the last emitted message, preserving
continuity across short responses and both boundary conventions.

Regression coverage must include disjoint cached context plus repeated reconnects while idle at the
bottom, original visible DOM-node identity, every sampled frame's bottom distance, context/latest and
jump-return navigation, interrupted renders, bounded recovery continuation, independent reader
cursors, restart membership and deleted recovery boundaries. Final scroll position alone is not an
adequate assertion for this failure mode.

## Ordinary history retention

The in-memory Store trims ordinary history per chat at 2,400 messages, targeting 2,000
with hysteresis. A detached reader keeps a contiguous interval around its actual visible
anchor plus 300 recent messages. Mounted rows, selected/action/reply/edit targets, draft
reply targets, recovery boundaries, pending/failed sends and complete media albums are
protected. Deletion archives retain their independent persistence and are not counted
against this ordinary-message budget. Protected records can temporarily exceed it.

Positioning and pending history transactions defer eviction; the existing snapshot-write
callback retries after positioning. Viewport registrations contain live getters, not DOM
nodes or message arrays, and dispose when their conversation unmounts. Account reset
clears them. Inactive conversations use the recent tail; a saved reading position outside
that tail is restored through the existing message-context loader.
An open channel-discussion panel temporarily protects its source and thread caches: that
panel has a separate thread-pagination owner. Closing it allows the ordinary policy to
resume; this change does not replace its pagination or trim its displayed comment list.

Eviction commits the message array and history-window membership together. It releases
ordinary file indexes, downstream download indexes and native raw-message/file indexes,
without deletion tombstones or removing locally retained copies. Empty context membership
is discarded; surviving disjoint intervals never become adjacent in one timeline.

Removing an older prefix resets the reader cursor to the surviving oldest message and
reopens older pagination. A reader interval with an evicted newer suffix exposes `hasNewer`;
downward input within one viewport requests one newer page. Negative TDLib history offsets
are shared by ordinary chats and forum topics. Short responses are walked back to the
starting boundary before publication, and one empty response does not prove exhaustion.
The controller captures latest membership before the request, since native publication
can precede its result. Overlap rejoins the intervals; End/latest selects the retained tail.

Regression coverage includes repeated live updates, hundreds of older/newer pages,
frame-by-frame reading stability, native early publication, short/empty newer responses,
file/raw-index release, archive/send/draft/album protection and reload after eviction.

## Private chat history deletion

The confirmation defaults to deleting only the current user's history. Deleting for both sides
requires an explicit checkbox selection and `chat.canDeleteForAllUsers === true`, mapped from TDLib's
`can_be_deleted_for_all_users`. The self-only and both-sides capabilities are independent; missing
capabilities authorize neither scope. An open confirmation retains its selected scope through
permission changes and failed attempts. Losing permission disables confirmation without silently
changing scope, and the user can still deselect the both-sides option.

The store checks the selected scope, and the native transport refreshes `getChat` before sending
`deleteChatHistory(remove_from_chat_list=true, revoke=forEveryone)`. The Rust request validator requires
an explicit boolean `revoke`; group/channel destruction via `deleteChat` remains unavailable.
Both scopes share the existing history-deletion boundary, retained-copy cleanup, account-generation
checks and protection for messages newer than the deleted history. Mock deletion validates scope and
local cleanup; another account's server history requires native integration verification.

## Cached message media identity

TDLib numeric file IDs are runtime handles, not persistent media identities. Both snapshot writing
and legacy snapshot migration clear main/thumbnail IDs and transfer flags from ordinary messages,
deletion archives, quoted messages, and nested article media. Remote IDs, unique IDs, and existing
local preview paths survive. A downloaded flag without a local path is not restorable readiness.

When the account is ready and online, `MediaFileRestorer` resolves persistent identities for the
selected conversation and deletion archives. Inactive ordinary conversations wait until selection.
Lookups deduplicate remote IDs and run with at most four workers. A selection during an in-flight
batch requests another pass. A new account invalidates old results. Missing, failed, or mismatched
identities may refresh the source message once per pass; they never authorize an old numeric handle.
Deleted and pending messages cannot use that fallback.

`MessageFileIndex` follows committed message reset/upsert/replace/remove events. A `file.updated`
event reaches ordinary cached messages even when they are absent from the transport's raw history
index. Match the numeric handle and available persistent identity before applying progress, local
paths, or completion. Unchanged file updates preserve object identity. Ordinary media follows TDLib
cache eviction; only deletion archives retain their independently owned local copies.

Media restoration does not change history membership, ordering, deletion facts, or viewport ownership.
It does not scan every conversation on each file update. Automatic download still follows the user's
media type and size preferences after a current handle is bound.

Native save failures keep their concrete IPC error in operation feedback. The native
`download_save_failed` log records only a fixed reason category, never paths, filenames, or raw OS
errors. Cache-root validation and export restrictions remain enforced.

Regression coverage includes legacy cache migration, repeated restart, automatic/manual download
without raw history hydration, independent thumbnail completion, nested/reply media, cache eviction,
account-generation cancellation, and concrete save failure feedback.

## Background update delivery

The native receive loop owns an ordered update queue for each main/settings WebView. Events only
wake the consumer; their payload never contains TDLib records. The consumer leases at most 64 records
and acknowledges a packet only after applying every record. Native read retries replay an unacknowledged
lease. Frontend application faults stop the stream instead of replaying a partially applied packet.
Closing a window or replacing its account session retires that window's stream; late closes cannot
retire a replacement stream. Reconnection retains the stream and ordinary sync-generation rules.

A suspended consumer spills ordered queue chunks beyond 512 records or 1 MiB of serialized content
to DPAPI-protected temporary files. This bounds the active memory buffer, with a separate bounded
reading chunk and one lease; it is not a total process-memory limit. Windows delete-on-close handles
remove spool contents even on process exit. Spill failures retain the current records and backpressure
the native receive loop. New messages, edits and deletions are never coalesced or dropped to reduce lag.

The frontend applies each lease in approximately 4 ms slices, yielding a macrotask between slices and
packets. The budget is cooperative: a single update cannot be preempted. Native receive diagnostics
include pending records, in-flight records and acknowledged batches. Optional UI diagnostics report
queue age and delivery duration separately from synchronous processing time.

Native connection recovery owns actual system-wake and network detection. Browser focus, visibility
and timer drift request only a non-forced check; background throttling alone must not reset a healthy
TDLib connection. Overlapping folder refreshes share chat lookups within the current sync generation.
Hidden folder warmup waits for a visible document and the selected list to finish loading.

Receiving a live update does not authorize a desktop notification. Public previews and linked
channel discussion groups can receive updates without membership. Notification eligibility requires
a known chat, and groups/channels require server-mapped `isMember === true`; private chats need no
membership flag and Saved Messages never notify. Check membership before resolving forum topics and
again against current state after the lookup, so leaving a group during the request cannot leak an
alert. Keep these updates in message history and discussion views; membership gates presentation,
not update delivery, and a followed channel has its own membership independent of its discussion group.

Regression coverage includes ordered new/edit/delete bursts through encrypted overflow, acknowledgement
and I/O retry behavior, session disposal, and user input while a large backlog is still being applied.

## Unread mention navigation

The TDLib chat mention count and per-message unread flags own mention state. The conversation
attention index is a navigation index, not a second unread authority. Restore explicit unread
mentions from cached snapshots and history pages; an old reply to an outgoing message alone does
not establish unread state. Live replies keep their existing local attention behavior.

The sidebar retains its attention badge when ordinary unread messages reach zero. The conversation
button includes mentions reported by the chat count even before their IDs have been loaded. Recover
those IDs through the existing unread-mention search on entry, count changes and reconnection;
coalesce requests and allow a click to retry. Search recovery must not expand the current history
window or mark messages read. Navigation loads the selected message's context through the existing
viewport owner and discards a delayed jump after another navigation or account change.

Only focused, visible message rows submit mention reads. A successful view request does not itself
clear a server-backed mention: retain the entry until TDLib reports the read, including when its
reaction is acknowledged first. A zero chat mention count clears known mention flags and entries
without consuming unrelated local replies or reactions. Late searches cannot overwrite newer
message state, restore deleted messages, or cross account generations; a reduced aggregate count
also invalidates a search snapshot that could contain a remotely read, uncached message.

## Local user blocking

Each account stores a per-user display mode with the existing local block record. Missing or
unknown modes retain the original `mask` behavior. Masking uses animal identities in groups and
discussions and supports the existing temporary reveal scopes. Sender tags and album captions
remain in layout while concealed; revealing a message or sender must not resize those surfaces.
An invisible real-name sizing span keeps a short animal alias from changing the bubble width.
Successful native metadata writes broadcast only the changed key; other windows reload the
durable records and notify their existing subscribers. A delayed reload cannot replace a newer
local edit. This keeps mode changes in the independent settings window visible in the chat window.

The `hide` mode excludes incoming messages before timeline grouping and virtualization, including
private chats, topics, discussion threads and the pinned view. It has no placeholder or reveal
override. Search results, shared media, media-viewer navigation, reply previews, draft/action
targets and chat-list previews must apply the same exclusion. Keep source messages available for
history synchronization and reply-sender resolution; display filtering must not delete server or
cached history. Changing back to masking or unblocking restores the original records.

Blocked unread reactions are filtered synchronously before attention indexing and rendering,
independently of remote read completion or failure. Precise unread sender metadata takes
precedence over older aggregate participants. Mixed or unknown unread senders preserve their
attention entry. Since TDLib's reaction read command is chat-wide, automatically issue it only
when all known unread reactions belong to blocked senders and the known message count covers the
server count; otherwise retain unrelated unread reactions until the existing visibility read path
can acknowledge them.

## Centered conversation notices

TDLib service events retain a small, whitelisted display model in `MessageContent.event`:
actor/member identities, readable event fields, related-message targets, and optional existing
local/minithumbnail photos. Never persist payment credentials, Passport payloads, gift redemption
codes, or Web App data in this model. Legacy service text/member IDs remain readable.

`presentServiceEvent` localizes events at render time and keeps person and message references
structured. `ServiceMessageContent` renders names in bold without underlines, supports existing
profile/message navigation, and folds secondary information into details. Name substitution must
not interpret user text as markup or template slots. Local user aliases apply to every identity,
and related-message summaries must not expose locally blocked content. Unknown message types use
a friendly fallback without protocol identifiers. Retained deleted service records explain their
state in a tooltip and accessible description instead of adding another visible line.

Timeline dates, floating dates, service messages, loading notices, and empty states share the
`conversation-notice` style and theme token. The token is blended with the canvas in advance so
floating notices keep the same color over messages or media. Floating notices use the measured
timeline center, accounting for scrollbar gutters and interface scaling; the alignment observer
never writes scroll position. Channel/discussion service rows reserve no avatar column and cannot
inherit channel-post bubble styles.

Regression coverage includes the pinned TDLib service-type inventory, event-specific wording and
amounts, multilingual names/details, local privacy, related-message navigation, photo fallback,
long names, light/dark themes, narrow windows, and alignment at 100% and 125% interface scale.
