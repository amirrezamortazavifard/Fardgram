# Focus ownership

The visible message editor is the default typing destination. Explicit search,
text selection, menus, dialogs, and keyboard navigation retain their own focus.
An OS window becoming active does not itself identify a message editor.

## Tab behavior

Every app window cancels the native Tab default in the shared WebView key guard,
including Shift+Tab and modified Tab keys delivered to the page. The event still
reaches application handlers: plain Tab explicitly accepts the active mention or
bot-command suggestion. With no available suggestion, it leaves text, selection,
and focus unchanged. Completion must not depend on `defaultPrevented` being false;
the guard has already canceled browser traversal. Existing IME checks still prevent
completion during composition.

Tab does not traverse settings, forms, dialogs, menus, or media controls. Dialogs
do not cycle focus with Tab, and menus do not dismiss on Tab. Pointer interactions,
explicit focus requests, menu arrow navigation, and Escape retain their behavior.

## Configurable shortcuts

`shortcuts/shortcuts.ts` declares action IDs, labels, defaults and key normalization.
Preferences persist bindings and synchronize them with the standalone settings
window. Navigation dispatch lives in `useAppShortcuts`; it only consumes a matching
combination, and preserves composition, active dialogs and menus. A usable cached
workspace accepts navigation while the transport reconnects. Tab remains reserved
for explicit completion and cannot be assigned to a navigation action.

The recorder consumes keys before editor/search commands and the WebView guard.
Escape, blur, switching controls and unmount invalidate pending checks. Saving
checks application duplicates and reserved keys, then probes Windows RegisterHotKey
on a dedicated thread and immediately unregisters it. These are foreground app
shortcuts; the probe never installs a persistent global binding. The probe detects
registered global hotkeys at that instant, not arbitrary keyboard hooks or later
registrations. Unsupported environments and native errors must not report success.

Folder buttons and shortcuts change only the sidebar folder and close search;
the open conversation, draft, reading position and forum topic remain in place,
including for empty folders and late list data. No per-folder chat selection is
remembered. After a folder change, the first previous/next chat shortcut selects
the current first row, even when the retained chat belongs to that folder. Later
shortcuts move from the selected chat; an explicit sidebar chat click also resumes
navigation from that row. Selecting the same folder does not reset navigation.
Actual chat changes share the sidebar conversation entry path. The folder order
matches the rail; chat order uses the sidebar sorter, with no wrap at either
boundary. The shortcut cursor is transient and resets across account switches.

## Conversation editors

`useComposerFocus` gives each editor an owner tied to its account and conversation
identity, including a forum topic or discussion thread. The concrete editor node is
also checked, so an old operation cannot target a replacement through a reused ref.
Disabling or unmounting an owner revokes pending requests and clears its timers.

- `request()` follows an explicit user action such as replying or inserting Emoji.
- Latest/return, pinned-message, reply-preview and attention jumps return typing
  to the current editor, retaining its selection. Silent-send toggles do the same.
  These returns use the existing owner and interaction checks; a subsequent
  search or conversation change takes precedence.
- Explicit multi-select cancellation commits the editor remount before requesting
  focus. Routine selection clearing (including asynchronous forwarding) does not
  make this request. Cancellation does not take focus from another surface.
- Emoji toggle, Escape and hover dismissals return focus only while that picker's
  controls or trigger still own it. Passive hovering and outside clicks preserve
  the user's current input destination.
- `request({ reason: "entry" })` defaults to the editor after navigation when focus
  is unclaimed or still on a chat row. It preserves native selections and the
  existing forced-colors keyboard behavior.
- Window return only restores unclaimed focus or retains the current editor.
  Search fields, buttons, reading controls, and selected text take precedence.
- `capture()` must be called **before** asynchronous work. Invoke its returned
  callback after completion; subsequent pointer, keyboard, composition, or focus
  activity invalidates it. Business callbacks that clear reply/edit state do not
  independently request focus.
- External previews can capture a return that waits for the main window to regain
  focus. Re-activation of the unchanged opener does not revoke that return;
  pointer, keyboard, composition, or focus on another element still does.
  Conversation video windows capture before any stream lookup, just like photo
  and outgoing attachment previews. In-app modals can remember their originating
  editor while allowing interactions inside the modal; return is still restricted
  to that editor.
- Replying from a native message menu waits for the main window to activate
  before focusing its conversation editor. A newer user operation revokes the
  pending return, as it does for media windows.

All editor focus requests use `preventScroll`. A cursor change is applied only
when its corresponding focus request remains valid. Requests do not run in a
hidden/unfocused document, during composition, behind an active modal, or against
an unavailable input.

The shared composer uses a Tiptap/ProseMirror text block with Telegram entities as
marks. Its DOM adapter exposes UTF-16 text offsets to existing mention insertion
and focus callers. Newlines occupy one position, including clipboard input.
Restored drafts start with a collapsed selection at the end; routine focus returns
preserve the current selection. Native and browser format menus retain the range
that opened them and return through the same focus owner.

With an empty composer, the configurable "Edit the previous message" shortcut
(Ctrl+R by default) chooses the latest editable outgoing
message intersecting that editor's current message viewport. Virtual overscan and
offscreen history do not qualify. Permission loading is bounded to those visible
candidates; subsequent input, scrolling, navigation, or unmounting cancels the
pending intent. Replies and attachment drafts retain their input behavior;
ArrowUp keeps its ordinary cursor or suggestion navigation. During editing, the
same shortcut or Escape cancels and restores the previous draft. Enter submits
the edit (Shift+Enter retains newline insertion), comparing the current text and
formatting entities with the original only at submission. Unchanged content,
including edits reverted to the original, exits without an edit/send request.
Composer Ctrl+Shift+M/X/U/B/Q/K shortcuts are local to this editor.
Formatting runs in ProseMirror's key handler and maps the visible DOM selection
before applying a mark; `selectionchange` may still be queued. React capture must
not consume these shortcuts against a stale selection. The editor and WebView
guard share physical letter matching, with `key` as a fallback.
Active IME composition owns its keys. Placeholder visibility follows the live
editor document and is suppressed from composition start, including empty preedit;
updating that visibility must never replace the composing document.

Composer surfaces follow the same order in ordinary chats and discussions:
outbox status, reply or edit context, staged attachments, then the editor.
Connection feedback floats above that stack, without consuming pointer input or
changing timeline/editor geometry as the network recovers. Text can wrap within
the conversation width; foreground choosers remain above this passive feedback.
Editing temporarily hides staged attachments and preserves their draft; attachment
sending cannot consume the edit text. Choosers anchor above the actual editor height
and fit below the owning conversation header. Only the foreground chooser handles
selection keys; opening the emoji picker suspends text suggestions until it closes.
Constrained attachment grids scroll without shrinking cards or hiding send controls.

Draft synchronization compares text entities by their content, independent of object
field order and entity order from the editor or native mapper. Matching server echoes
acknowledge local drafts without discarding staged attachments. While newer local text
is pending, rejected stale echoes (including empty drafts) cannot clear attachments;
accepted remote draft replacements retain the existing attachment cleanup behavior.

Mention candidates combine actual authors from the current chat's loaded history,
search results and discussion messages with TDLib's `chatMembersFilterMention`
results. Local authors remain available while the remote request is pending, empty
or fails; membership-list visibility does not decide whether a known author can
be mentioned. Forward origins, mention entities and globally cached users do not
establish chat scope. Preserve the server's mention eligibility and name matching,
including non-member commenters and names matched through aliases or transliteration.
Incoming messages update local matches without restarting the remote query. Query
completion caches and late responses remain scoped to the current chat and account.

Before native text sends, draft writes, edits or attachment captions, resolve mention
IDs through TDLib `getUser` and its `have_access` flag. Frontend cached authors are
display hints, not proof of native access. If needed, restore at most three known
authored message references with `getMessage`, then try the user's known public
username while verifying that it still resolves to the same user ID. Recovery does
not publish history, mark messages read, change focus or remove mention entities.
Concurrent lookups share pending work within the account; completed lookups are
not treated as permanent access. Account changes cancel pending sends, and newer
drafts or clears supersede delayed draft preparation, independently per topic.

`data-composer-scope` marks ordinary conversations and discussion panels. The
shared pointer handler processes only the nearest scope. A discussion isolates
the channel header, timeline, and post editor with `inert`; the covered channel
editor must never receive comment text or Enter.
When the scope's editor already has focus, pointer down on a non-selectable
background preserves that focus and selection, and pointer up skips restoration.
Selectable message text and interactive controls retain their native pointer
behavior. An unfocused editor still receives focus after an eligible blank click.

## Modal surfaces

`useModalFocus` owns initial focus, programmatic focus containment, and return.
Only the active modal handles Escape. Its sibling branches are made inert,
including newly mounted background content. Nested
dialogs isolate siblings rather than their own ancestors. Portaled context menus
retain their keyboard interaction. Standalone settings retain their window chrome.

Isolation is released when the exit begins. A delayed unmount cannot move focus
over a newer user operation. Temporarily suspending/hiding a parent for a nested
dialog does not consume that parent's eventual return. Prefer the invoking control;
an editor-related modal can supply a return bound to its originating editor.

## Verification

`tests/e2e/focus.e2e.ts` and `tests/e2e/focus-actions.e2e.ts` cover typing destination,
delayed completion, background isolation, window return, selections, caret position,
and exit races. Existing
composer, message action, discussion, media, report, motion, and account suites
cover their integrations. Browser tests run headless with muted audio and Mock
transport. Real WebView2 activation, Alt+Tab, native previews, and OS IME still
require Windows acceptance against the packaged build.
