# Changelog

Notable Fardgram changes are recorded here. Versions follow Semantic Versioning,
with prerelease identifiers used for release candidates.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.0-rc.5] - 2026-09-18

Windows x64 candidate with an NSIS installer and a portable ZIP. Both packages
include the pinned TDLib runtime and build-time Telegram API credentials.

### Added

- Add chat folder filters, stable bulk selection, and more TDLib chat context-menu
  actions, plus Telegram invite-link handling and localized reporting.
- Add rich composer formatting, visible-message editing, and responsive mention
  suggestions that include conversation authors and support hidden-member groups.
- Add configurable local quote folding and richer, consistent conversation service
  notices with participant, topic, call, payment, and message-link details.

### Changed

- Unify photo and video viewing, with lightweight video previews, application-owned
  playback sessions, mixed media navigation, recoverable errors and continuous
  playback when switching to a small window. Coordinate audio/video ownership and
  exact cache leases; schedule TDLib ranges with bounded workers, source cancellation
  and full-download arbitration. Add first-frame, seek and frame-quality metrics.
- Fade deleted messages and smoothly lower the messages above them while keeping
  the lower messages anchored, including virtualized histories and reduced motion.
- Add an opt-in local copy of incoming messages that are permanently deleted by
  another party, render retained copies as semi-transparent read-only messages,
  and automatically cache original photos while the feature is enabled. Self-
  destructing, expiring, protected, and locally deleted messages remain excluded.
- Calibrate frame-drop estimates against the current window's active display refresh
  rate and attach bounded evidence, focus, frame-budget, script, and region context to
  performance records.
- Rework Settings into a more compact and consistent layout, keep the account page
  focused on the current account, constrain long blocked-sender lists, and remove
  the former developer tools and remote-debugging controls.
- Store cache and download locations as environment-variable paths, defaulting to
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dev.fardgram.desktop\tdlib` and
  `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\downloads` on Windows.
- Store portable account configuration, TDLib login state, media cache, and
  WebView2 data beside the executable under `data/`, while installed builds keep
  their existing per-user application data locations.
- License the Fardgram source under MIT and include the project license in Windows
  release bundles alongside the existing third-party notices.

### Fixed

- Restore saved conversation reading positions, follow newly arrived messages only
  when the full tail fits, and preserve bottom alignment through delayed layouts.
- Paginate ordinary history past retained deleted-message archives, keep quote
  collapse anchored to the pointer, and restore composer focus after chat actions.
- Improve original-image loading, viewer sizing and zoom, cached-file recovery,
  media download state, IME composition, and bot start-link compatibility.
- Separate playback buffering from download progress, preserve valid video ranges
  when seeking, and size loading posters to the video. Make the small video window
  draggable across its surface, with transparent surroundings and automatically
  hidden translucent controls.
- Confirm empty history boundaries and retry stalled pages without moving the older
  cursor forward. Keep permanent deletions, sent message ID replacements, and newer
  edits authoritative when delayed history or context responses arrive.
- Preserve visible incoming messages after remote deletion even if TDLib's raw cache
  has been evicted, and keep retained copies outside the ordinary startup cache quota.
- Serialize native Range downloads per media file so concurrent header and metadata-tail
  probes cannot replace each other's TDLib download window and leave sparse, unplayable media.
- Close layered fullscreen video from the blank surface in both preview and playback modes.
- Advance native audio stream buffer windows with the active playback position and
  preserve validated audio MIME types, preventing large high-bitrate files such as
  FLAC tracks from stalling after the initial 8 MiB range.
- Allow strictly validated TDLib file-download cancellation requests through the
  WebView bridge so cancel actions stop the underlying transfer.
- Separate measured UI stalls from asynchronous backend waits and incomplete tracing,
  so an eight-second conversation trace timeout no longer implies an eight-second
  frozen interface.
- Justify received photo and video albums across the complete message bubble,
  selecting compact rows from item count and source proportions so mixed albums
  no longer leave an empty grid cell.

## [0.5.0-rc.4] - 2026-08-22

This candidate contains the latest conversation, forwarding, attachment,
activity tracking, and native context-menu fixes. The release includes the
Windows installer and portable package only; the standalone prebuilt TDLib
runtime archive is intentionally not published.

## [0.5.0-rc.3] - 2026-08-21

### Added

- Offer a hash-pinned Windows x64 TDLib runtime package alongside source builds,
  with verified Release download and selectable CI preparation paths.
- Start Fardgram automatically after Windows sign-in through an explicit desktop
  setting, keeping automatic launches quietly available from the system tray.
- Restore the main window's last normal position, size, and maximized state on the
  next launch, while moving stale off-screen placements into an available work area.
- Navigate links opened from conversations with back and forward controls or mouse
  side buttons, without recording ordinary conversation-list switches as jumps.
- Reopen forum groups at their last topic and switch topics from a compact horizontal
  strip containing only the topic avatar, name, and unread counter, with mouse-wheel
  horizontal scrolling when the strip overflows.
- Send selected videos, audio, animations, photos, and documents as native Telegram
  media with probed dimensions, duration, generated covers, spoiler/caption placement,
  original-file mode, compatible mixed albums, and native-path-safe validation.
- Participate in Telegram polls and quizzes, including multiple-choice submissions,
  result updates, correct-answer explanations, restrictions, and vote revocation.
- Pin and unpin messages with Telegram notification scope, browse and jump through
  pinned messages, and configure preset or custom chat auto-delete durations.
- Browse server-paginated shared media by category with search and date filters,
  TTL-backed indexing, message jumps, batch downloads, forwarding, and deletion.
- Continue adjacent audio and voice messages automatically within the active
  conversation while retaining a single active playback session.
- Queue attachment uploads while offline with encrypted snapshot metadata,
  persistent browser storage, SHA-256 change detection, expiry and quota limits,
  reconnect recovery, cancellation, and explicit retry states.
- Create basic groups, supergroups, and channels with initial members,
  descriptions, public usernames, history visibility, permission templates,
  and native-path-safe chat photo selection.
- Add a lightweight WebView performance timeline for startup, interaction, rendering,
  history, and media stalls, backed by a separately rotated performance log.
- Search the current conversation from the shared sidebar field through TDLib with
  stable pagination, total counts, a searchable sender filter, exact
  context loading, and a member-avatar context-menu shortcut.
- Add a muted inline video surface, Alt-click floating playback, and progress-preserving
  fullscreen transitions with compact controls for narrow conversations.

### Changed

- Route Ctrl+F to the shared sidebar search field with the active conversation as an
  explicit scope, keep direct sidebar input global, and return to global results when
  the conversation scope is removed.
- Move pinned-list message navigation into a compact action at each bubble's
  top-right corner and remove the redundant linked-channel jump button.
- Replace the pinned-message preview dialog with an in-conversation pinned-message
  view, a persistent header strip that advances through earlier pins as their source
  messages enter the viewport, per-message history jumps, and exact return-position
  restoration without injecting non-contiguous pinned history into the normal timeline.
- Keep the forum group name in topic conversation headers and remove the redundant
  back-to-topic-list control.
- Cache bounded forum-topic metadata with per-group selection state so forum entry
  paints immediately while topic metadata and history refresh in the background.
- Coalesce forum-topic refreshes, reuse fresh topic/read state, and load only the
  destination topic when opening a search result or notification.
- Preserve TDLib voice-note duration before media loading and disable unavailable
  voice controls instead of presenting an inert play action.
- Merge chat and message search into the single conversation-sidebar field, return
  global chat results without mutating the canonical chat list through a second
  request, and hide the contacts navigation entry until it is assigned a new location.
- Treat all search input as plain text and remove the local regular-expression mode.
- Prefetch image and video covers above the viewport, replace percentage media loaders
  with rotating indicators, and stop paused streams after a bounded buffer window.
- Present fullscreen video controls in a light 550-by-80 floating panel that hides
  after pointer inactivity, and route Space to the selected video without activating
  the currently focused non-text control.

### Fixed

- Keep the latest messages immediately above a newly opened reply or edit context
  while preserving the visible anchor when the user has scrolled away from the bottom.
- Stop conversation search from restarting itself whenever its loading state changes,
  and keep the searchable member picker open while results update.
- Keep pinned-message jumps smooth by avoiding redundant same-chat selection,
  suppressing the transient target flash, and ignoring clicks when the pinned
  source message is already visible.
- Give captioned media a stable readable card width without letting short captions
  shrink wide media, keep incoming and outgoing geometry identical, and scale the
  complete media frame proportionally in narrow conversations.
- Prevent rapid forum history initialization from leaving the virtual message list
  stuck in its positioning state and delaying conversation performance traces.

## [0.5.0-rc.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Preserve messages when TDLib evicts them only from its local cache, avoid
  inferring deletions from incomplete history windows, and stabilize ordering
  for messages sent within the same second.

## [0.5.0-rc.1] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Connection recovery, native notifications, complete media actions, cache
  management, and automatic download controls.
- Paginated global search with filters, exact context loading, profiles,
  contacts, members, chat organization, and server-backed folder management.
- Deterministic Mock browser coverage and isolated native smoke evidence.
- Traceable portable and NSIS artifacts, signed stable/candidate update channels,
  forward-only rollback policy, and isolated install/upgrade/uninstall lifecycle
  verification.
- User-exported redacted diagnostics, opt-in local crash reports, and settings
  that keep crash capture disabled by default.
- Automated 125%/150%/200% DPI, forced-colors, long-text, narrow-screen,
  keyboard, and accessibility-tree release checks.

### Security

- Per-account DPAPI-protected database keys, constrained local-file commands,
  trusted media asset paths, and recursively redacted structured logs.
- Release builds reject hidden local inputs, publish dependency/license and
  SHA-256 inventories, verify the pinned TDLib runtime, and sign native binaries.
- Diagnostic export removes string values, identifiers, messages, credentials,
  phone numbers, and local paths before creating the ZIP archive.
