# Fardgram

Fardgram is a desktop-first third-party Telegram client built with React, TypeScript, Tauri 2, and TDLib. It includes messaging, multi-account storage, native authorization, paginated chat/history synchronization, server-backed search, rich media, reactions, and a mock browser runtime.

The desktop stack is already on Tauri 2: the frontend uses the v2 JavaScript API and plugins, the Rust application depends on the v2 crates, and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` uses the `config/2` schema with v2 capabilities. References to Tauri elsewhere in this document mean Tauri 2 unless stated otherwise.

## Browser development

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Set `VITE_TELEGRAM_TRANSPORT=mock`, then open `http://127.0.0.1:1420`. Use `http://127.0.0.1:1420/?auth=1` to exercise the mock authorization flow. A local `.env` set to `tauri` intentionally requires the native shell and will not run in an ordinary browser.

## Native TDLib development

The native application needs a Windows x64 TDLib runtime. The fastest setup is
to download the pinned prebuilt package from the matching GitHub Release:

```powershell
npm run tdlib:fetch
```

The download is accepted only when the archive SHA-256 and all four runtime
file hashes match `scripts/tdlib/version.json`. To build the same pinned TDLib
commit from official source instead, install Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools with
the Desktop development with C++ workload and run:

```powershell
npm run tdlib:build
```

The initial source build downloads TDLib and vcpkg dependencies and can take
several minutes. Subsequent builds reuse `vendor/`. Source builds are validated
for required files and exports but are not required to be byte-identical to the
published package. You can also set `NOTGRAM_TDLIB_PATH` to a compatible custom
library or its containing directory.

Create `.env` from `.env.example`, set the native transport and API credentials,
then start the application:

```env
VITE_TELEGRAM_TRANSPORT=tauri
NOTGRAM_API_ID=123456
NOTGRAM_API_HASH=replace_with_your_value
```

```powershell
npm run tauri dev
```

`NOTGRAM_API_ID` and `NOTGRAM_API_HASH` are consumed by Rust and are not sent to
the webview. `.env`, TDLib binaries, source, dependencies, and build outputs are
ignored by Git. TDLib source revisions, prebuilt Release location, runtime
hashes, and the vcpkg baseline are pinned in `scripts/tdlib/version.json` and
`scripts/tdlib/vcpkg.json`.

New account databases receive a random per-account encryption key protected for
the current Windows user. `NOTGRAM_DATABASE_KEY_BASE64` is only an explicit
override for existing development databases and is not copied into portable
releases.

## Portable Windows builds

For a local portable build, run one command from the repository root:

```powershell
npm run build:portable
```

The command loads build variables from the root `.env`, skips the full test and
lint suite, and writes each run to a unique timestamp-and-commit directory under
`artifacts/portable/`. Existing artifacts are never replaced. `.env` is injected
only into the build process and is never copied into the portable directory or
ZIP.

Use `npm run publish:portable` for a strict release build. That command requires
a clean worktree, runs the full repository checks, and reads API credentials
only from the process environment. Pass `-DestinationRoot` directly to
`scripts/publish-portable.ps1` when a release needs a custom destination. The
versioned ZIP contains `Fardgram.exe`, the Fardgram project license, TDLib and its
runtime licenses, dependency inventory, build metadata, and per-file SHA-256
hashes.
Release builds remap local source roots to stable placeholders and refuse to
package files that still contain the build user's profile or repository path.
Portable builds retain account data across ZIP replacement and do not run the
NSIS auto-updater; installed builds use the signed channel configured at build
time.
On first start, a portable build creates a `data/` directory beside
`Fardgram.exe`. `data/config/` contains the encrypted account registry, database
keys, proxy settings, storage settings, diagnostics consent, and window state;
`data/tdlib/` contains the TDLib login databases, encrypted UI snapshots, and
media cache; `data/webview/` contains WebView2 local storage and browser data.
The default cache setting is stored as the relative path `data/tdlib`, so the
whole portable directory can be moved without retaining an old absolute path.
Preserve the existing `data/` directory when replacing the executable and
runtime files with a newer ZIP. Release ZIPs never contain account data.

Installed builds keep the existing locations: account configuration and TDLib
login databases under `%APPDATA%/dev.fardgram.desktop/`, and the TDLib cache plus
WebView2 data under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/dev.fardgram.desktop/`. Portable and installed
profiles are intentionally separate; an existing installed profile is not
copied into a portable directory automatically.
After a bundled Tauri build, `npm run publish:installer` validates and stages
the matching NSIS installer with the same dependency, metadata, and hash files.
Before publishing a signed release, run `scripts/test-release-lifecycle.ps1` in
an isolated local environment. It probes portable startup, ZIP replacement,
current-user installation, in-place replacement, uninstallation, retained
account data, and explicit test-data cleanup without opening Telegram or
starting the network runtime. Use the separate isolated product identifier to
verify a real previous-version upgrade before the signed production build.
Uninstall keeps account data by policy; remove accounts and clear media cache in
the app before uninstall when local data must be erased.

The bridge searches these locations in order:

1. `NOTGRAM_TDLIB_PATH`
2. Packaged `resources/tdlib/`
3. The app data `tdlib/` directory
4. The executable directory
5. `src-tauri/tdlib/` during development

`version.json` is the single application version source. Release tags and
changelog rules are documented in
[`docs/release-versioning.md`](docs/release-versioning.md).

Real TDLib acceptance is tracked separately from browser mocks. See
[`docs/native-smoke.md`](docs/native-smoke.md) for the isolated clean-profile and
existing-account passes, their non-sensitive evidence format, verification
commands, and the opt-in loopback Playwright endpoint for the real Tauri DOM.

The automated accessibility gate and native Windows checklist are documented in
[`docs/accessibility-matrix.md`](docs/accessibility-matrix.md).

Browser suite selection, targeted runs, diagnostic capture, and baseline
maintenance are documented in [`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

## Architecture

```text
windows/               Independent HTML entries for auxiliary windows
src/windows/           Auxiliary window bootstraps and shared mounting
src/components/        React UI, authorization, message/media, and settings screens
src/store/             Application state, preferences, and ordered event reduction
src/telegram/          Transport contract plus mock/Tauri adapters
src-tauri/src/         TDLib dynamic loader, receive loop, and commands
src-tauri/icons/       Windows packaging icons and the shared PNG source
tests/e2e/             Headless, muted browser regression tests and snapshot baselines
tests/fixtures/public/ Mock media served only with the mock transport
scripts/               Development checks, TDLib tooling, and release commands
docs/                  Maintained architecture contracts and operating guides
docs/archive/          Historical audits tied to their original baselines
```

`index.html` remains the main application entry. Auxiliary windows use
`/windows/*-window.html` in both development and production; their entry paths
must stay synchronized with the native window builders and browser bridges.
The independent entries preserve separate loading for each window.

Unit tests live beside their source and Vitest only collects tests under `src/`.
Keep temporary baseline checkouts outside the repository. Git ignore rules do
not define test discovery or development-server watch boundaries.

Mock builds and browser development serve `tests/fixtures/public/` at the URL
root. With `VITE_TELEGRAM_TRANSPORT=tauri`, Vite disables that public directory
so native frontend builds omit the mock media. Keep production resources out of
the mock fixture directory. Android and iOS icon sets are intentionally omitted
while Windows is the release baseline.

Generated output belongs in ignored directories: TypeScript build metadata in
`node_modules/.cache/`, development and E2E server logs in `logs/`, test output
in `test-results/`, and build or diagnostic evidence in `artifacts/`. Redirect
ad hoc command logs into `logs/` instead of the repository root. Root manifests,
tool configurations, and the local `project.md` and `.env` keep their existing
locations.

The native bridge uses TDLib's current `td_create_client_id`, `td_send`, and `td_receive` interface. One dedicated Rust thread owns `td_receive`; updates are copied immediately and emitted to the webview in the order received. Rust automatically answers `authorizationStateWaitTdlibParameters`, while user-facing authorization states remain in the TypeScript store.

After authorization, the TDLib transport synchronizes the current user,
paginated main/folder chat lists, user presence, paginated
message history, outgoing text messages, send-failure retry state, read state,
chat and sender avatars, and common real-time chat/message updates. Message
metadata preserves replies, forward origins, edit timestamps, reactions,
and current operation permissions. Reply, edit, delete, forward, retry, download,
and emoji reaction actions are available in the conversation UI. Sender
profile photos are downloaded through TDLib and refreshed when updateFile
completes. The Tauri asset protocol starts with an empty static scope and only
authorizes completed TDLib files that were observed in trusted per-account roots;
cached snapshot paths are canonicalized and checked before exact-file authorization.
Consecutive messages from the same sender use joined Telegram-style
bubbles, local-calendar date separators, show the sender name only on the first item, and keep the sender avatar floating near
the bottom of the visible portion of its message group while scrolling. Timestamps render with
second precision. Photo messages use a sender header
only when they start a consecutive group; subsequent photos are borderless.
History is preloaded in
30-message pages and continues loading when the message list is scrolled upward.
Each account and chat keeps its reading position for the current application
session. First entry and a double-click on a chat open the latest message; when
the reader is away from the bottom, new messages stay off-screen behind a
counted jump-to-latest button instead of moving the viewport.
On startup, the UI restores a DPAPI-protected snapshot from the configured cache
directory while TDLib connects in parallel; live server updates always replace
cached chat, folder, user, and message state. The generated local archive folder
is not shown or loaded. History requests are deferred until authorization is
ready. Each chat keeps an independent server-history cursor and always starts
its first refresh from TDLib's latest window, even if a live message arrived
first. History refreshes acknowledge cached messages that TDLib returns but do
not infer deletion from gaps in a page. Only non-cache deletion updates remove
messages; partial or stalled responses preserve the existing cache and remain
retryable instead of marking history complete.
Documents and Telegram media messages are mapped separately: image documents
remain file cards, while photos, videos, video notes, animations, audio, voice,
and stickers render with previews, download state, and native playback where applicable.
Photos and stickers are cached automatically through TDLib `updateFile` events. Completed user
downloads are copied to the configured download directory without overwriting
existing files. The cache path defaults to the Windows app cache directory, while
downloads default to the downloads folder beside Fardgram.exe; both paths are
configurable under Advanced Settings. Settings provides account management,
notification/sound preferences, compact chat and send-key behavior, animation
preferences, proxy controls, and storage paths. Native file upload is available
through a Rust-owned file picker so local paths are never exposed to the webview.

Local unsent text, attachment manifests, and outbox state are stored separately
from the replaceable UI snapshot. New attachments use account-owned DPAPI chunks
(1 MiB per IPC transfer, 512 MiB per batch, 2 GiB total); owned legacy IndexedDB
batches are verified and migrated on startup. Legacy batches with unknown account
ownership are retained without guessing an owner. Settings lists recoverable
native batches and storage layers. Media cache, exported downloads, WebView data,
and logs are not covered by application-level DPAPI encryption.

Cache directory changes take effect on restart after verified copying. The old
cache remains as a migration backup until explicitly reclaimed in Settings. A
failed migration keeps the previous runtime directory. Cache cleanup delegates
ordinary media deletion to TDLib and preserves active conversations/transfers;
it does not clear local drafts or exported downloads. Signing out removes the
selected account's app-owned data and records while preserving exported files.
Interrupted outbox sends require review before retry; accepted attachment groups
are recorded so a retry can skip them.

The desktop conversation list starts at 360 pixels wide and can be resized from its right edge
down to a 300-pixel minimum. The preferred width is restored on the next launch. Default chat
rows, avatars, message text, headers, and the composer use a unified daily-messaging scale, while
the narrow layout keeps its full-width conversation switching behavior.

Phone-number and QR-code authorization are supported. QR login uses TDLib's
`requestQrCodeAuthentication` flow and redraws whenever TDLib rotates the
confirmation link.

## Runtime logs

Fardgram writes structured lifecycle and receive-loop statistics to
`logs\fardgram.log` beside the executable. The app log rotates at 2 MB. Raw
TDLib logging is disabled because it may include account, network, or message
data that cannot be reliably redacted.

The receive loop blocks for up to one second while idle and enforces a 25 ms
minimum cycle when TDLib returns immediately. Receive errors use exponential
backoff up to one second, and bridge error events are limited to one every five
seconds. A `receive_stats` record is written once per minute with poll, update,
error, and polls-per-second counts. Structured log values are recursively
redacted before being written and intentionally omit credentials, authentication
secrets, phone numbers, paths, and message bodies.

History pagination also writes `ui_history_data`, `ui_history_merge`, and
`ui_history_render` records with request/merge/render duration, batch sizes,
and scroll-anchor drift. Main-thread tasks over 50 ms are sampled as
`ui_long_task` at most once every ten seconds. These records contain only
numeric and boolean diagnostics and never include chat IDs or message content.

## Diagnostics and crash reports

The native **Diagnostics and privacy** settings can export a ZIP selected by the
user. Export applies a second redaction pass to bounded runtime-log records and
includes a manifest that identifies the application version, distribution kind,
architecture, and record count. It never includes message text, credentials,
account/chat/message identifiers, phone numbers, or local paths.

Crash reporting is disabled by default. Opting in stores one minimal crash event
locally with only a fixed event type, application version, and timestamp;
nothing is uploaded.
The record is included only when the user manually exports diagnostics and is
deleted when crash reporting is disabled. Corrupt consent settings fail closed.

## Proxy settings

Fardgram uses the Windows system proxy by default. On Windows, the current
per-user explicit proxy is read from Internet Settings every time the app
starts. If no explicit system proxy is enabled, system mode falls back to a
direct connection.

The connection dialog is available before login and from the main navigation.
It supports system, direct, custom HTTP, SOCKS5, and MTProto modes, including a
TDLib connection test. Custom settings are encrypted for the current Windows
user with DPAPI before being written to the application configuration directory;
proxy passwords and secrets are never written to logs.

Existing databases created before per-account keys are registered as legacy
empty-key databases during the first upgrade and remain readable. New databases
use a random DPAPI-protected key rather than `.env`.
